  Abstract                 = {Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision. In this extended abstract, we show that shal- low feed-forward networks can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets and achieve accuracies previously only achievable with deep models. Moreover, in some cases the shallow neural nets can learn these deep functions using a total number of parameters similar to the original deep model. We eval- uate our method on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task and are able to train shallow fully-connected nets that perform similarly to complex, well-engineered, deep convolutional architectures. Our success in training shallow neural nets to mimic deeper models suggests that there probably exist better algorithms for train- ing shallow feed-forward nets than those currently available.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of recovering shape, albedo, and illumination from a single grayscale image of an object, using shading as our primary cue. Because this problem is fundamentally underconstrained, we construct statistical models of albedo and shape, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. We present two priors on albedo which en- courage local smoothness and global sparsity, and three priors on shape which encourage flatness, outward-facing orientation at the occluding contour, and local smoothness. We present an optimization technique for using these pri- ors to recover shape, albedo, and a spherical harmonic model of illumination. Our model, which we call SAIFS (shape, albedo, and illumination from shading) produces reasonable results on arbitrary grayscale images taken in the real world, and outperforms all previous grayscale in- trinsic image-style algorithms on the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite having high accuracy, neural nets have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial examples, where a small perturbation to an input can cause it to become mislabeled. We propose metrics for measuring the robustness of a neural net and devise a novel algorithm for approximating these metrics based on an encoding of robustness as a linear program. We show how our metrics can be used to evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates of robustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms. Furthermore, we show how existing approaches to improving robustness "overfit" to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm. Finally, we show that our techniques can be used to additionally improve neural net robustness both according to the metrics that we propose, but also according to previously proposed metrics.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent availability of video-cameras with CCD-type sensors (charge coupled device) has proved to be particularly stimulating for all those applications requiring photometric measurements, above all for the measurement of luminance values related to the physical and technical qualities of a built environment. This method allows the instantaneous capture of an image, thus enabling collection of luminance values relating to the points of measurement; this in turn leads to the evaluation of luminance distribution and lighting levels of the surfaces that make up the environment. Setting up this system requires the following basic configuration: a photopic filter V($\lambda$), an optic interface, a computer equipped with an appropriate card for the capture and digitalisation of the acquired image (the grqqframe grabber) and, finally, suitable software for the processing of collected data. In this article a detailed description of this acquisition system is reported, and subsequently a report on the procedure adopted for its calibration so as to enable the capture of relevant photometric values. Final analysis and validation of results are carried out by means of field test. A case study of CCD photometerapplication has been then performed using a basic software tool autonomously developed to evaluate indoor lighting level; the luminance map of a diffuse light source has been used as grqqinput data for the developed software, and the grqqoutput data, i.e. illumination levels, have been then compared with measured values.},

  Abstract                 = {As deep nets are increasingly used in applications suited for mobile devices, a fundamental dilemma becomes apparent: the trend in deep learning is to grow models to absorb ever-increasing data set sizes; however mobile devices are designed with very little memory and cannot store such large models. We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional methods of computer vision and machine learning cannot match human performance on tasks such as the recognition of handwritten digits or traffic signs. Our biologically plausible deep artificial neural network architectures can. Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winnertake-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of common image classification benchmarks.},

The book includes rigorous proofs of core results in compressive sensing and wavelet convergence. Fundamental is the treatment of the linear system y=$\Phi$x in both finite and infinite dimensions. There are three possibilities: the system is determined, overdetermined or underdetermined, each with different aspects. The authors assume only basic familiarity with advanced calculus, linear algebra and matrix theory and modest familiarity with signal processing, so the book is accessible to students from the advanced undergraduate level. Many exercises are also included.},

  Abstract                 = {Perspective projection is generally accepted as the ideal model of image formation. Many recent algorithms, and many recent judgements about the relative merits of different algorithms, depend on this assumption. However, perspective projection represents only the front half of the viewing sphere and it distorts the shape and intensity of objects unless they lie near the optical axis. It is only one of several projections used in lens design and it does not accurately model the behavior of many real lenses. It works well only for narrow-angle images. This paper surveys the properties of several alternative models of image formation. A model based on stereographic projection of the viewing sphere is shown to be a better general-purpose imaging model than perspective projection. The new model can represent wider fields of view and more closely approximates real wide-angle lenses. It preserves a suitable range of shape properties, including local symmetries. It approximates narrow-angl...},

  Abstract                 = {The neocognitron is a neural network model proposed by. Fukushima (1980). Its architecture was suggested by neurophysiological findings on the visual systems of mammals. It is a hierarchical multi-layered network. It acquires the ability to robustly recognize visual patterns through learning. Although the neocognitron has a long history, modifications of the network to improve its performance are still going on. For example, a recent neocognitron uses a new learning rule, named add-if-silent, which makes the learning process much simpler and more stable. Nevertheless, a high recognition rate can be kept with a smaller scale of the network. Referring to the history of the neocognitron, this paper discusses recent advances in the neocognitron. We also show that various new functions can be realized by, for example, introducing top-down connections to the neocognitron: mechanism of selective attention, recognition and completion of partly occluded patterns, restoring occluded contours, and so on. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {k-Decision lists and decision trees play important roles in learning theory as well as in practical learning systems.k-Decision lists generalize classes such as monomials,k-DNF, andk-CNF, and like these subclasses they are polynomially PAC-learnable [R. Rivest,Mach. Learning2(1987), 229--246]. This leaves open the question of whetherk-decision lists can be learned as efficiently ask-DNF. We answer this question negatively in a certain sense, thus disproving a claim in a popular textbook [M. Anthony and N. Biggs, ``Computational Learning Theory,'' Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, UK, 1992]. Decision trees, on the other hand, are not even known to be polynomially PAC-learnable, despite their widespread practical application. We will show that decision trees are not likely to be efficiently PAC-learnable. We summarize our specific results. The following problems cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of 2log$\delta$ nfor any$\delta${\textless}1, unlessNP⊂DTIME[2polylog n]: a generalized set cover,k-decision lists,k-decision lists by monotone decision lists, and decision trees. Decision lists cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a factor ofn$\delta$, for some constant$\delta${\textgreater}0, unlessNP=P. Also,k-decision lists withl0--1 alternations cannot be approximated within a factor logl nunlessNP⊂DTIME[nO(log log n)] (providing an interesting comparison to the upper bound obtained by A. Dhagat and L. Hellerstein [in``FOCS '94,'' pp. 64--74]).},

Our results apply to both convex and non-convex optimization under standard Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions. Applying our results to the convex case, we provide new explanations for why multiple epochs of stochastic gradient descent generalize well in practice. In the nonconvex case, we provide a new interpretation of common practices in neural networks, and provide a formal rationale for stability-promoting mechanisms in training large, deep models. Conceptually, our findings underscore the importance of reducing training time beyond its obvious benefit.},

In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which further makes training easy and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10/100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.},

We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex- tremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative im- provement on the COCO object detection dataset.

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra com-putational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 clas-sification dataset.

  Abstract                 = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g., 224224) input image. This requirement is ``artificial'' and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, ``spatial pyramid pooling'', to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-theart classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank {\#}2 in object detection and {\#}3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.},

Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate.

The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated.},

Integrability can be enforced easily because both surface height and gradient are represented. (A gradient field is integrable if it is the gradient of some surface height function.) The robustness of the method stems in part from linearization of the reflectance map about the current estimate of the surface orientation at each picture cell. (The reflectance map gives the dependence of scene radiance on surface orientation.) The new scheme can find an exact solution of a given shape-from-shading problem even though a regularizing term is included. The reason is that the penalty term is needed only to stabilize the iterative scheme when it is far from the correct solution; it can be turned off as the solution is approached. This is a reflection of the fact that shape-from-shading problems are not ill posed when boundary conditions are available, or when the image contains singular points.},

  Abstract                 = {A method will be described for finding the shape of a smooth apaque object form a monocular image, given a knowledge of the surface photometry, the position of the lightsource and certain auxiliary information to resolve ambiguities. This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the objects. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this metod will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program.},

Effective driving of a unit required a stimulus specific in form, size, position, and orientation; based on the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas. About 20{\%} of the cortical units studied could be activated from either eye; these were driven from roughly homologous regions of the retinas and summation and antagonism could be shown.

  Abstract                 = {By the laws of quantum physics, pixel intensity does not have a true value, but should be a random variable. Contrary to the conventional assumptions, the distribution of intensity may not be an additive Gaussian. We propose to directly model the intensity difference, and show its validity by an experimental comparison to the conventional additive model. As a model of the intensity difference, we present a Skellam distribution derived from the Poisson photon noise model. This modeling induces a linear relationship between intensity and Skellam parameters, while conventional variance computation methods do not yield any significant relationship between these parameters under natural illumination. The intensity-Skellam line is invariant to scene, illumination and even most of camera parameters. We also propose practical methods to obtain the line using a color pattern and an arbitrary image under a natural illumination. Because the Skellam parameters that can be obtained from this linearity determine a noise distribution for each intensity value, we can statistically determine whether any intensity difference is caused by an underlying signal difference or by noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new noise model by applying it to practical applications of background subtraction and edge detection.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology and integration have resulted in vehicle-borne platforms for urban LIDAR scanning, such as Terrapoint Inc.'s TITAN system. Such technology has lead to an explosion in ground LIDAR data. The large size of such mobile urban LIDAR data sets, and the ease at which they may now be collected, has shifted the bottleneck of creating abstract urban models for Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from data collection to data processing. While turning such data into useful models has traditionally relied on human analysis, this is no longer practical. This thesis outlines a methodology for automatically recovering the necessary information to create abstract urban models from mobile urban LIDAR data using computer vision methods. As an integral part of the methodology, a novel scale-based interest operator is introduced (Difference of Normals) that is efficient enough to process large datasets, while accurately isolating objects of interest in the scene according to real-world parameters. Finally a novel localized object recognition algorithm is introduced (Local Potential Well Space Embedding), derived from a proven global method for object recognition (Potential Well Space Embedding). The object recognition phase of our methodology is discussed with these two algorithms as a focus.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new method for creating computationally efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using low-rank representations of convolutional filters. Rather than approximating filters in previously-trained networks with more efficient versions, we learn a set of small basis filters from scratch; during training, the network learns to combine these basis filters into more complex filters that are discriminative for image classification. To train such networks, a novel weight initialization scheme is used. This allows effective initialization of connection weights in convolutional layers composed of groups of differently-shaped filters. We validate our approach by applying it to several existing CNN architectures and training these networks from scratch using the CIFAR, ILSVRC and MIT Places datasets. Our results show similar or higher accuracy than conventional CNNs with much less compute. Applying our method to an improved version of VGG-11 network using global max-pooling, we achieve comparable validation accuracy using 41{\%} less compute and only 24{\%} of the original VGG-11 model parameters; another variant of our method gives a 1 percentage point increase in accuracy over our improved VGG-11 model, giving a top-5 center-crop validation accuracy of 89.7{\%} while reducing computation by 16{\%} relative to the original VGG-11 model. Applying our method to the GoogLeNet architecture for ILSVRC, we achieved comparable accuracy with 26{\%} less compute and 41{\%} fewer model parameters. Applying our method to a near state-of-the-art network for CIFAR, we achieved comparable accuracy with 46{\%} less compute and 55{\%} fewer parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the connections between two state of the art classifiers: decision forests (DFs, including decision jungles) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Decision forests are computationally efficient thanks to their conditional computation property (computation is confined to only a small region of the tree, the nodes along a single branch). CNNs achieve state of the art accuracy, thanks to their representation learning capabilities. We present a systematic analysis of how to fuse conditional computation with representation learning and achieve a continuum of hybrid models with different ratios of accuracy vs. efficiency. We call this new family of hybrid models conditional networks. Conditional networks can be thought of as: i) decision trees augmented with data transformation operators, or ii) CNNs, with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices, and explicit data routing functions. Experimental validation is performed on the common task of image classification on both the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Compared to state of the art CNNs, our hybrid models yield the same accuracy with a fraction of the compute cost and much smaller number of parameters.},

The locations of the local minima are then used to generate feature vectors, which can be matched against a preprocessed database of such features to determine correspondences between images and models. The method has been implemented and tested on real data, and has been found to be effective at recognizing sparse segmented (self-)occluded range images.

The goal of this work is to investigate if image values can be transformed to physically meaningful values, and if so, when and how this can be done. From our analysis, we found a major limitation of the imaging model employed in conventional radiometric calibration methods and propose a new in-camera imaging model that fits well with today's cameras. With the new model, we present associated calibration procedures that allow us to convert an sRGB images back to their original CCD RAW responses in a manner that is significantly more accurate than any existing methods. Additionally, we show how this new imaging model can be used to build an image correction application that converts an sRGB input image captured with the wrong camera settings to an sRGB output image that would have been recorded under the correct settings of a specific camera.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the latest high-end smartphone has powerful CPU and GPU, running deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for complex tasks such as ImageNet classification on mobile devices is challenging. To deploy deep CNNs on mobile devices, we present a simple and effective scheme to compress the entire CNN, which we call one-shot whole network compression. The proposed scheme consists of three steps: (1) rank selection with variational Bayesian matrix factorization, (2) Tucker decomposition on kernel tensor, and (3) fine-tuning to recover accumulated loss of accuracy, and each step can be easily implemented using publicly available tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by testing the performance of various compressed CNNs (AlexNet, VGGS, GoogLeNet, and VGG-16) on the smartphone. Significant reductions in model size, runtime, and energy consumption are obtained, at the cost of small loss in accuracy. In addition, we address the important implementation level issue on 1?1 convolution, which is a key operation of inception module of GoogLeNet as well as CNNs compressed by our proposed scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it difficult to learn a good set of filters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is significantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

Given a layer, we use non-linear least squares to compute a low-rank CP-decomposition of the 4D convolution kernel tensor into a sum of a small number of rank-one tensors. At the second step, this decomposition is used to replace the original convolutional layer with a sequence of four convolutional layers with small kernels. After such replacement, the entire network is fine-tuned on the training data using standard backpropagation process. We evaluate this approach on two CNNs and show that it yields larger CPU speedups at the cost of lower accuracy drops compared to previous approaches. For the 36-class character classification CNN, our approach obtains a 8.5x CPU speedup of the whole network with only minor accuracy drop (1{\%} from 91{\%} to 90{\%}). For the standard ImageNet architecture (AlexNet), the approach speeds up the second convolution layer by a factor of 4x at the cost of 1{\%} increase of the overall top-5 classification error.},

By using a discrete formulation of the problem, it is possible to achieve good convergence behavior by employing numerical solution techniques more powerful than gradient descent methods derived from variational calculus. Because this method solves directly for height, it avoids the problem of finding an integrable surface maximally consistent with surface orientation. Furthermore, since additional constraints are not needed to make the problem well posed, a smoothness constraint is used only to drive the system towards a good solution; the weight of the smoothness term is eventually reduced to near zero. By solving directly for height, stereo processing may be used to provide initial and boundary conditions. The shape from shading technique, as well as its relation to stereo, is demonstrated on both synthetic and real imagery},

  Abstract                 = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day},

  Abstract                 = {Research over the last decade has built a solid mathematical foundation for representation and analysis of 3D meshes in graphics and geometric modeling. Much of this work however does not explicitly incorporate models of low-level human visual attention. In this paper we introduce the idea of mesh saliency as a measure of regional importance for graphics meshes. Our notion of saliency is inspired by low-level human visual system cues. We define mesh saliency in a scale-dependent manner using a center-surround operator on Gaussian-weighted mean curvatures. We observe that such a definition of mesh saliency is able to capture what most would classify as visually interesting regions on a mesh. The human-perception-inspired importance measure computed by our mesh saliency operator results in more visually pleasing results in processing and viewing of 3D meshes. compared to using a purely geometric measure of shape. such as curvature. We discuss how mesh saliency can be incorporated in graphics applications such as mesh simplification and viewpoint selection and present examples that show visually appealing results from using mesh saliency.},

  Abstract                 = {Our proposed deeply-supervised nets (DSN) method simultaneously minimizes classification error while making the learning process of hidden layers direct and transparent. We make an attempt to boost the classification performance by studying a new formulation in deep networks. Three aspects in convolutional neural networks (CNN) style architectures are being looked at: (1) transparency of the intermediate layers to the overall classification; (2) discriminativeness and robustness of learned features, especially in the early layers; (3) effectiveness in training due to the presence of the exploding and vanishing gradients. We introduce "companion objective" to the individual hidden layers, in addition to the overall objective at the output layer (a different strategy to layer-wise pre-training). We extend techniques from stochastic gradient methods to analyze our algorithm. The advantage of our method is evident and our experimental result on benchmark datasets shows significant performance gain over existing methods (e.g. all state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN).},

  Abstract                 = {Individuals susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are characterised by an abnormal increase of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in hypoxia and during normoxic exercise, reduced hypoxic ventilatory response, and smaller lung volume. In 37 mountaineers with well-documented altitude tolerance, it was investigated whether any combination of these noninvasive measurements, including exercise in hypoxia, could improve the identification of HAPE-susceptible subjects at low altitude. HAPE-susceptible subjects showed a significant higher increase of PASP during hypoxia at rest (48+/-10 mmHg) compared with controls (38+/-3 mmHg), as well as during normoxic exercise (57+/-14 versus 38+/-7 mmHg) and hypoxic exercise (69+/-13 versus 49+/-8 mmHg). PASP could not be assessed in three and eight subjects during normoxic or hypoxic exercise, respectively, due to insufficient Doppler profiles or systemic arterial hypertension. Sensitivity (77-94{\%}) and specificity (76-93{\%}) were not significantly different between the various testing conditions. Additional assessment of hypoxic ventilatory response and lung function parameters did not improve identification of HAPE-susceptible subjects in a multivariate analysis. Due to the greater number of missing values in pulmonary artery systolic pressure measurements during hypoxic exercise, it was concluded that pulmonary artery systolic pressure measurements at rest during hypoxia or exercise in normoxia are most feasible for the identification of high-altitude pulmonary oedema-susceptible subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a signiﬁcant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times.

  Abstract                 = {Significant progress has recently been made by applying tools fromclassical projective and algebraic geometry to fundamental problems in computer vision. To some extent this work was foreshadowed by early mathematical photogrammetrists. However the modern approach has gone far beyond these early studies, particularly as regards our ability to deal with multiple images and unknown camera parameters, and on practical computational issues such as stability, robustness and precision. These new techniques are greatly extending the scope and flexibility of digital photogrammetric systems. This tutorial provides a practical, applications-oriented introduction to the projective geometry needed to understand these new developments. No currently available textbook covers all of this material, although several existing texts consider parts of it. Kanatanis book 11 studies many computational and statistical aspects of computer vision in a projective framework. Faugeras 4 investigates the geometric aspects of 3D vision, including several of the projective results obtained by his team before 1993. The collections edited by Mundy, Zisserman and Forsyth 18, 19 summarize recent research on the applications of geometric invariants to computer vision: projective results are central to this programme. Mathematical introductions to projective geometry can be found in many books. A standard text covering the necessary aspects of both projective and algebraic geometry is Semple and Kneebone 23. Unfortunately this is currently out of print, however many scientific libraries have it and it is said to be reprinting soon.},

  Abstract                 = {This work addresses the challenging problem of simultaneously segmenting multiple anatomical structures in highly varied CT scans. We propose the entangled decision forest (EDF) as a new discriminative classifier which augments the state of the art decision forest, resulting in higher prediction accuracy and shortened decision time. Our main contribution is two-fold. First, we propose entangling the binary tests applied at each tree node in the forest, such that the test result can depend on the result of tests applied earlier in the same tree and at image points offset from the voxel to be classified. This is demonstrated to improve accuracy and capture long-range semantic context. Second, during training, we propose injecting randomness in a guided way, in which node feature types and parameters are randomly drawn from a learned (nonuniform) distribution. This further improves classification accuracy. We assess our probabilistic anatomy segmentation technique using a labeled database of CT image volumes of 250 different patients from various scan protocols and scanner vendors. In each volume, 12 anatomical structures have been manually segmented. The database comprises highly varied body shapes and sizes, a wide array of pathologies, scan resolutions, and diverse contrast agents. Quantitative comparisons with state of the art algorithms demonstrate both superior test accuracy and computational efficiency.},

The learning and inference rules for these ``Stepped Sigmoid Units'' are unchanged. They can be approximated eﬃciently by noisy, rectiﬁed linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face veriﬁcation on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectiﬁed linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors.},

  Abstract                 = {An articulated trajectory is defined as a trajectory that remains at a fixed distance with respect to a parent trajectory. In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct an articulated trajectory in three dimensions given the two dimensional projection of the articulated trajectory, the 3D parent trajectory, and the camera pose at each time instant. This is a core challenge in reconstructing the 3D motion of articulated structures such as the human body because endpoints of each limb form articulated trajectories. We simultaneously apply activity-independent spatial and temporal constraints, in the form of fixed 3D distance to the parent trajectory and smooth 3D motion. There exist two solutions that satisfy each instantaneous 2D projection and articulation constraint (a ray intersects a sphere at up to two locations) and we show that resolving this ambiguity by enforcing smoothness is equivalent to solving a binary quadratic programming problem. A geometric analysis of the reconstruction of articulated trajectories is also presented and a measure of the reconstructibility of an articulated trajectory is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Shape from shading is known to be an ill-posed problem. We show in this paper that if we model the problem in a different way than it is usually done, more precisely by taking into account the 1/r2 attenuation term of the illumination, shape from shading becomes completely well-posed. Thus the shading allows to recover (almost) any surface from only one image (of this surface) without any additional data (in particular, without the knowledge of the heights of the solution at the local intensity "minima", contrary to P. Dupuis et al. (1994), E. Prados et al. (2004), B. Horn (1986), E. Rouy et al. (1992), R. Kimmel et al. (2001)) and without regularity assumptions (contrary to J. Oliensis et al. (1993), R. Kimmel et al. (1995), for example). More precisely, we formulate the problem as that of solving a new partial differential equation (PDE), we develop a complete mathematical study of this equation and we design a new provably convergent numerical method. Finally, we present results of our new shape from shading method on various synthetic and real images.},

  Abstract                 = {Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its ad- vantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality re- duction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strate- gies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality. This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by random- ized modification of resolution. We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral param- eterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model un- changed, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training. 1},

Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

  Abstract                 = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently evinced immense success for various image recognition tasks. However, a question of paramount importance is somewhat unanswered in deep learning research - is the selected CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size? In this paper, we intend to answer this question and introduce a novel strategy that alters the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical splitting. Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two operations. We evaluate our approach on two natural scenes attributes datasets, SUN Attributes and CAMIT-NSAD, with architectures of GoogleNet and VGG-11, that are quite contrasting in their construction. We justify our choice of datasets, and show that they are interestingly distinct from each other, and together pose a challenge to our architectural refinement algorithm. Our results substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method.},

Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters.

  Abstract                 = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in deep learning have made the use of large, deep neural net- works with tens of millions of parameters suitable for a number of applications that require real-time processing. The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3× improve- ment over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10× speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4× speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce DropConnect, a generalization of DropOut, for regularizing large fully-connected layers within neural networks. When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.}

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing definition of a context for object recognition. Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},
