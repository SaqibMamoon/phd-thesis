\begin{dedication} 

To my mother, Diane, who has tirelessly supported me over 36 years,\\
without asking the question ``When will you graduate?''\\
At least not very often.
\vspace{6.66em}\\
Also to my friends in Cambridge, especially Jesus College, who have made my short time here a thoroughly enjoyable one. Perhaps too much so.\vspace{1em}\\

Finally, to my girlfriend Jin-A Lee, who has patiently sustained a relationship with me across over 10,000 km, something for which any duration of time is too long, never mind 6 years.\\
I hope this brings us one step closer to living in the same place.
