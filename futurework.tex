Here we outline the research directions I plan to pursue, planned conference submissions and a preliminary research schedule.

\section{Future Research Topics}

\subsection{Learning a Basis for Spatial and Channel Extents of Filters}
\label{journalplan}
The work of chapters \ref{lowrankfilters} and \ref{deeproots} explore learning more efficiently by reducing the learned parameters in the spatial and channel extents, respectively, of convolutional filters. These naturally lend themselves to being merged into a single effective method for training with low-rank basis filters. We plan to submit a journal article in which both methods are merged and explored in new results on state-of-the-art deep networks.

\subsection{Learning Structural Priors}
