\chapter{Trained Models}
\label{trainedmodels}
Although all the details for reproducing the experiments presented in this thesis are detailed in the relevant chapters, we have endevoured to make most of the models open-access, and have archived these with permanent \acrlongpl{doi}.
\section*{\Cref{lowrankfilters}}
%\section*{Training CNNs with Low-Rank Filters for Efficient Image Classification}
Trained models for \cref{lowrankfilters} can be found here:\\

\section*{\Cref{deeproots}}
Trained models for \cref{deeproots} can be found here:\\
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.116680}{doi:10.5281/zenodo.116680}
\section*{\Cref{conditionalnetworks}}
Unfortunately the models and code for these experiments will not be publically released. They were joint work partly pursued while on a research internship at Microsoft Research.
