  Abstract                 = {Arising from courses taught by the authors, this largely self-contained treatment is ideal for mathematicians who are interested in applications or for students from applied fields who want to understand the mathematics behind their subject. Early chapters cover Fourier analysis, functional analysis, probability and linear algebra, all of which have been chosen to prepare the reader for the applications to come. The book includes rigorous proofs of core results in compressive sensing and wavelet convergence. Fundamental is the treatment of the linear system y=Φx in both finite and infinite dimensions. There are three possibilities: the system is determined, overdetermined or underdetermined, each with different aspects. The authors assume only basic familiarity with advanced calculus, linear algebra and matrix theory and modest familiarity with signal processing, so the book is accessible to students from the advanced undergraduate level. Many exercises are also included.},

  Abstract                 = {Training of large-scale deep neural networks is often constrained by the available computational resources. We study the effect of limited precision data representation and computation on neural network training. Within the context of low-precision fixed-point computations, we observe the rounding scheme to play a crucial role in determining the network's behavior during training. Our results show that deep networks can be trained using only 16-bit wide fixed-point number representation when using stochastic rounding, and incur little to no degradation in the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate an energy-efficient hardware accelerator that implements low-precision fixed-point arithmetic with stochastic rounding.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g., 224224) input image. This requirement is ``artificial'' and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, ``spatial pyramid pooling'', to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-theart classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank \#2 in object detection and \#3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.},

  Abstract                 = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day},

  Abstract                 = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

Unlike existing methods that are designed for approximating linear filters or linear responses, our method takes the nonlinear units into account. We develop an effective solution to the resulting nonlinear optimization problem without the need of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). More importantly, while current methods mainly focus on optimizing one or two layers, our nonlinear method enables an asymmetric reconstruction that reduces the rapidly accumulated error when multiple (e.g., \&gt;=10) layers are approximated. For the widely used very deep VGG-16 model, our method achieves a whole-model speedup of 4x with merely a 0.3\% increase of top-5 error in ImageNet classification. Our 4x accelerated VGG-16 model also shows a graceful accuracy degradation for object detection when plugged into the latest Fast R-CNN detector.},

Unlike existing methods that are designed for approximating linear filters or linear responses, our method takes the nonlinear units into account. We minimize the reconstruction error of the nonlinear responses, subject to a low-rank constraint which helps to reduce the complexity of filters. We develop an effective solution to this constrained nonlinear optimization problem. An algorithm is also presented for reducing the accumulated error when multiple layers are approximated. A whole-model speedup ratio of 4x is demonstrated on a large network trained for ImageNet, while the top-5 error rate is only increased by 0.9\%. Our accelerated model has a comparably fast speed as the "AlexNet", but is 4.7\% more accurate.},
