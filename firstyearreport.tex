\title{First Year Report}
\author{Yani A.~Ioannou}
\maketitle

Although I am nearing the end of my first year of studies at the University of Cambridge, I transferred to this program having already been in a PhD program since November of 2014, at the University of Bath and Microsoft Research. It should not be surprising then that I had made significant research progress already, and in the course of the degree have authored several papers: 

\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{Ioannou2015}
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{Ioannou2016}
	\item \bibentry{shankar2016refining}
	\item \footnotemark[1]\bibentry{ioannou2016deep}
	\item \bibentry{bastani2016measuring}
\end{itemize}


I plan to request for an exemption of 3 research terms to be able to submit my dissertation at the end of my second year, and so rather than write a research proposal, I have used the opportunity of this report to create a first draft of my dissertation for comment. This is mostly composed of those papers above for which I am first author (marked by \footnotemark[1]). The details of the contributions of these papers to the dissertation are detailed in the acknowledgements section.

This does mean however, that the following report significantly surpasses the standard first year report length of 15,000 words. In the interests of reader's time, I suggest that feedback be focused on the background and current work sections (last chapter), and the cohesiveness of the dissertation as a whole.
